# 🔐 Splunk SOC Lab – Security Monitoring & Detection

## 📌 Repository Overview

This repository contains hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) lab projects using **Splunk Enterprise**. It demonstrates real-world Linux monitoring, SSH brute-force detection, and real-time alerting.

The goal is to showcase practical SOC skills for internship or entry-level roles in cybersecurity.

##  Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Linux SOC Monitoring & Real-Time Alerting System

- Monitored authentication and system logs across multiple Linux endpoints (RHEL 10 & Zorin OS)  
- Built real-time dashboards for infrastructure and security auditing  
- Configured critical alerts for brute-force detection and service health monitoring  
- Performed deep-dive log analysis to identify unauthorized access

### 2️⃣ SOC SSH Brute Force Detection Lab

- Simulated SSH brute-force attacks using Hydra  
- Collected and forwarded logs to Splunk for monitoring  
- Created SPL queries to detect repeated failed login attempts  
- Configured real-time alerts for immediate SOC response

## 🛠 Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

- **SIEM:** Splunk Enterprise (Dashboarding, Alerting, SPL queries)  
- **Linux Security:** Log analysis (`/var/log/secure`, `/var/log/messages`)  
- **SOC Operations:** Attack simulation, monitoring, real-time alerts  
- **Endpoint Monitoring:** Configuring Splunk Universal Forwarders  
- **Security Analysis:** Incident investigation, dashboard reporting

## 🎯 Why This Repository Stands Out

- Combines realistic SOC scenarios with hands-on Splunk monitoring  
- Demonstrates practical blue-team skills for junior cybersecurity roles  
- Shows documentation, dashboards, alerts, and investigative skills that recruiters look for in interns
